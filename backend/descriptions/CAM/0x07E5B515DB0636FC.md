ease - smooth transition between the camera's positions
easeTime - Time in milliseconds for the transition to happen

If you have created a script (rendering) camera, and want to go back to the 
character (gameplay) camera, call this native with render set to 0.
Setting ease to 1 will smooth the transition.
