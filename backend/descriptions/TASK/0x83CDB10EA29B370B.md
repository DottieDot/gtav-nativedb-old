It's similar to the one above, except the first 6 floats let you specify the initial position and rotation of the task. (Ped gets teleported to the position). animTime is a float from 0.0 -> 1.0, lets you start an animation from given point. The rest as in AI::TASK_PLAY_ANIM. 

Rotation information : rotX and rotY don't seem to have any effect, only rotZ works.
