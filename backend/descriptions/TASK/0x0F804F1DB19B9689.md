Not clear what it actually does, but here's how script uses it - 

if (OBJECT::HAS_PICKUP_BEEN_COLLECTED(...) 
{
 if(ENTITY::DOES_ENTITY_EXIST(PLAYER::PLAYER_PED_ID()))
    {
     AI::TASK_CLEAR_LOOK_AT(PLAYER::PLAYER_PED_ID());
  }
 ...
}

Another one where it doesn't "look" at current player - 

AI::TASK_PLAY_ANIM(l_3ED, "missheist_agency2aig_2", "look_at_phone_a", 1000.0, -2.0, -1, 48, v_2, 0, 0, 0);
PED::_2208438012482A1A(l_3ED, 0, 0);
AI::TASK_CLEAR_LOOK_AT(l_3ED);
