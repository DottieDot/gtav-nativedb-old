Example:

AI::TASK_DRIVE_BY(l_467[1/*22*/], PLAYER::PLAYER_PED_ID(), 0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.0, 300.0, 100, 0, ${firing_pattern_burst_fire_driveby});




Needs working example. Doesn't seem to do anything.

I marked p2 as targetVehicle as all these shooting related tasks seem to have that in common.
I marked p6 as distanceToShoot as if you think of GTA's Logic with the native SET_VEHICLE_SHOOT natives, it won't shoot till it gets within a certain distance of the target.
I marked p7 as pedAccuracy as it seems it's mostly 100 (Completely Accurate), 75, 90, etc. Although this could be the ammo count within the gun, but I highly doubt it. I will change this comment once I find out if it's ammo count or not.
