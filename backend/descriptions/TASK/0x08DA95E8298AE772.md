//this part of the code is to determine at which entity the player is aiming, for example if you want to create a mod where you give orders to peds
Entity aimedentity;
Player player = PLAYER::PLAYER_ID();
PLAYER::_GET_AIMED_ENTITY(player, &aimedentity);

//bg is an array of peds
AI::TASK_SHOOT_AT_ENTITY(bg[i], aimedentity, 5000, GAMEPLAY::GET_HASH_KEY("FIRING_PATTERN_FULL_AUTO"));

in practical usage, getting the entity the player is aiming at and then task the peds to shoot at the entity, at a button press event would be better.
