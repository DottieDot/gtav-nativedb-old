Creates a mobile phone of the specified type.

Possible phone types:

0 - Default phone / Michael's phone
1 - Trevor's phone
2 - Franklin's phone
4 - Prologue phone

These values represent bit flags, so a value of '3' would toggle Trevor and Franklin's phones together, causing unexpected behavior and most likely crash the game.
