Return variable is never used in R*'s scripts.

Not sure what p2 does. It seems like it would be a time judging by it's usage in R*'s scripts, but didn't seem to affect anything in my testings.

x, y, and z are coordinates, most likely to where the ped will fall.

p7 is probably the force of the fall, but untested, so I left the variable name the same.

p8 to p13 are always 0f in R*'s scripts.

(Simplified) Example of the usage of the function from R*'s scripts:
ped::set_ped_to_ragdoll_with_fall(ped, 1500, 2000, 1, -entity::get_entity_forward_vector(ped), 1f, 0f, 0f, 0f, 0f, 0f, 0f);
