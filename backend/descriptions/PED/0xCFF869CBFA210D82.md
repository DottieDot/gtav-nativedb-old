Returns size of array, passed into the second variable.

See below for usage information.

This function actually requires a struct, where the first value is the maximum number of elements to return.  Here is a sample of how I was able to get it to work correctly, without yet knowing the struct format.

//Setup the array
 const int numElements = 10;
   const int arrSize = numElements * 2 + 2;
  Any veh[arrSize];
 //0 index is the size of the array
    veh[0] = numElements;

   int count = PED::GET_PED_NEARBY_VEHICLES(PLAYER::PLAYER_PED_ID(), veh);

 if (veh != NULL)
  {
     //Simple loop to go through results
       for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
        {
         int offsettedID = i * 2 + 2;
          //Make sure it exists
         if (veh[offsettedID] != NULL && ENTITY::DOES_ENTITY_EXIST(veh[offsettedID]))
          {
             //Do something
            }
     }
 }
