forceFlags:
First bit (lowest): Strong force flag, factor 100
Second bit: Unkown flag
Third bit: Momentum flag=1 (vector (x,y,z) is a momentum, more research needed)
If higher bits are unequal 0 the function doesn't applay any forces at all.
(As integer possible values are 0-7)

0: weak force
1: strong force
2: same as 0 (2nd bit?)
3: same as 1
4: weak momentum
5: strong momentum
6: same as 4
7: same as 5

isLocal: vector defined in local (body-fixed) coordinate frame
isMassRel: if true the force gets multiplied with the objects mass (this is why it was known as highForce) and different objects will have the same acceleration.

p8 !!! Whenever I set this !=0, my script stopped.
