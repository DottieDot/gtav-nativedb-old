Returns an integer value of entity's current health.

Example of range for ped:
- Player [0 to 200]
- Ped [100 to 200]
- Vehicle [0 to 1000]
- Object [0 to 1000]

Health is actually a float value but this native casts it to int.
In order to get the actual value, do:
float health = *(float *)(entityAddress + 0x280);
