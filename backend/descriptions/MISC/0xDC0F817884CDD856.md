Directly from R*:
enum eDispatchType : uint16_t
{
	DT_PoliceAutomobile = 1,
	DT_PoliceHelicopter = 2,
	DT_FireDepartment = 3,
	DT_SwatAutomobile = 4,
	DT_AmbulanceDepartment = 5,
	DT_PoliceRiders = 6,
	DT_PoliceVehicleRequest = 7,
	DT_PoliceRoadBlock = 8,
	DT_PoliceAutomobileWaitPulledOver = 9,
	DT_PoliceAutomobileWaitCruising = 10,
	DT_Gangs = 11,
	DT_SwatHelicopter = 12,
	DT_PoliceBoat = 13,
	DT_ArmyVehicle = 14,
	DT_BikerBackup = 15
};

By making toggle false it disables the dispatch.

curious if this is what they used when you toggled on and off cops in a GTA IV freemode you hosted. Sad they got rid of the option to make a private session without cops.
Also on x360 seems with or without neverWanted on, setting these to all false in SP of course doesn't seem to work. I would understand getting stars, but cops are still dispatched and combat you.
