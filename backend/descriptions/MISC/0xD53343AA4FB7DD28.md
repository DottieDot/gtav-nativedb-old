Another extremely useful native.

You can use it simply like:
if (GAMEPLAY::GET_RANDOM_INT_IN_RANGE(0, 2))

and the if-statement will count it as false only if the random int is 0. That means there is a one in three chance of it being false. Put a "!" in front and it means there is a one in three chance of it being true.
