Finds a position ahead of the player by predicting the players next actions.
The positions match path finding node positions.
When roads diverge, the position may rapidly change between two or more positions. This is due to the engine not being certain of which path the player will take.

=======================================================
I may sort this with alter research, but if someone
already knows please tell what the difference in 
X2, Y2, Z2 is. I doubt it's rotation. Is it like 
checkpoints where X1, Y1, Z1 is your/a position and
X2, Y2, Z2 is a given position ahead of that position?
