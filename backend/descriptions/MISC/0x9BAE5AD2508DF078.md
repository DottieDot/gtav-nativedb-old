Formerly known as _LOWER_MAP_PROP_DENSITY and wrongly due to idiots as _ENABLE_MP_DLC_MAPS.
Sets the maximum prop density and changes a loading screen flag from 'loading story mode' to 'loading GTA Online'. Does not touch DLC map data at all.

In fact, I doubt this changes the flag whatsoever, that's the OTHER native idiots use together with this that does so, this one only causes a loading screen to show as it reloads map data.
