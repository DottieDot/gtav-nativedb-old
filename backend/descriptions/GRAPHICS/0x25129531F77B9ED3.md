C#

Function.Call<int>(Hash.START_PARTICLE_FX_NON_LOOPED_AT_COORD, = you are calling this function.

char *effectname = This is an in-game effect name, for e.g. "scr_fbi4_trucks_crash" is used to give the effects when truck crashes etc

float x, y, z pos = this one is Simple, you just have to declare, where do you want this effect to take place at, so declare the ordinates

float xrot, yrot, zrot = Again simple? just mention the value in case if you want the effect to rotate.

float scale = is declare the scale of the effect, this may vary as per the effects for e.g 1.0f

bool xaxis, yaxis, zaxis = To bool the axis values.

example:
Function.Call<int>(Hash.START_PARTICLE_FX_NON_LOOPED_AT_COORD, "scr_fbi4_trucks_crash", GTA.Game.Player.Character.Position.X, GTA.Game.Player.Character.Position.Y, GTA.Game.Player.Character.Position.Z + 4f, 0, 0, 0, 5.5f, 0, 0, 0);
