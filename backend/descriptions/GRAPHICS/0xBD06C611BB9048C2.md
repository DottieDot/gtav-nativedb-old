Similar to REQUEST_SCALEFORM_MOVIE, but seems to be some kind of "interactive" scaleform movie?

These seem to be the only scaleforms ever requested by this native:
"breaking_news"
"desktop_pc"
"ECG_MONITOR"
"Hacking_PC"
"TEETH_PULLING"

Note: Unless this hash is out-of-order, this native is next-gen only.
