dirX/Y/Z represent a heading on each axis in which the marker should face, alternatively you can rotate each axis independently with rotX/Y/Z (and set dirX/Y/Z all to 0).

faceCamera - Rotates only the y-axis (the heading) towards the camera

p19 - no effect, default value in script is 2

rotate - Rotates only on the y-axis (the heading)

textureDict - Name of texture dictionary to load texture from (e.g. "GolfPutting")

textureName - Name of texture inside dictionary to load (e.g. "PuttingMarker")

drawOnEnts - Draws the marker onto any entities that intersect it

basically what he said, except textureDict and textureName are totally not const char*, or if so, then they are always set to 0/NULL/nullptr in every script I checked, eg:

bj.c: graphics::draw_marker(6, vParam0, 0f, 0f, 1f, 0f, 0f, 0f, 4f, 4f, 4f, 240, 200, 80, iVar1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, false);

his is what I used to draw an amber downward pointing chevron "V", has to be redrawn every frame.  The 180 is for 180 degrees rotation around the Y axis, the 50 is alpha, assuming max is 100, but it will accept 255.

GRAPHICS::DRAW_MARKER(2, v.x, v.y, v.z + 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 180, 0, 2, 2, 2, 255, 128, 0, 50, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0);
