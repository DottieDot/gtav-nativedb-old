Parameters:
* pos - coordinate where the spotlight is located
* dir - the direction vector the spotlight should aim at from its current position
* r,g,b - color of the spotlight
* distance - the maximum distance the light can reach
* brightness - the brightness of the light
* roundness - "smoothness" of the circle edge
* radius - the radius size of the spotlight
* falloff - the falloff size of the light's edge (example: www.i.imgur.com/DemAWeO.jpg)

Example in C# (spotlight aims at the closest vehicle):
Vector3 myPos = Game.Player.Character.Position;
Vehicle nearest = World.GetClosestVehicle(myPos , 1000f);
Vector3 destinationCoords = nearest.Position;
Vector3 dirVector = destinationCoords - myPos;
dirVector.Normalize();
Function.Call(Hash.DRAW_SPOT_LIGHT, pos.X, pos.Y, pos.Z, dirVector.X, dirVector.Y, dirVector.Z, 255, 255, 255, 100.0f, 1f, 0.0f, 13.0f, 1f);
