x,y,z = start pos
x2,y2,z2 = end pos

Draw's a 3D Box between the two x,y,z coords.
--------------
Keep in mind that the edges of the box do only align to the worlds base-vectors. Therefore something like rotation cannot be applied. That means this function is pretty much useless, unless you want a static unicolor box somewhere.
I recommend using a predefined function to call this.
[VB.NET]
Public Sub DrawBox(a As Vector3, b As Vector3, col As Color)
    [Function].Call(Hash.DRAW_BOX,a.X, a.Y, a.Z,b.X, b.Y, b.Z,col.R, col.G, col.B, col.A)
End Sub

[C#]
public void DrawBox(Vector3 a, Vector3 b, Color col)
{
    Function.Call(Hash.DRAW_BOX,a.X, a.Y, a.Z,b.X, b.Y, b.Z,col.R, col.G, col.B, col.A);
}
