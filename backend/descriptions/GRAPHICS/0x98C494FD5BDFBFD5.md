Pushes a function from the Hud component Scaleform onto the stack. Same behavior as GRAPHICS::BEGIN_SCALEFORM_MOVIE_METHOD, just a hud component id instead of a Scaleform.

Known components:
19 - MP_RANK_BAR
20 - HUD_DIRECTOR_MODE

This native requires more research - all information can be found inside of 'hud.gfx'. Using a decompiler, the different components are located under "scripts\__Packages\com\rockstargames\gtav\hud\hudComponents" and "scripts\__Packages\com\rockstargames\gtav\Multiplayer".
