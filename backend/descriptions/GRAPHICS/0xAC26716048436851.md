x/y/z - Location of a vertex (in world coords), presumably.
----------------
x1, y1, z1     : Coordinates for the first point
x2, y2, z2     : Coordinates for the second point
x3, y3, z3     : Coordinates for the third point
r, g, b, alpha : Color with RGBA-Values

Keep in mind that only one side of the drawn triangle is visible: It's the side, in which the vector-product of the vectors heads to: (b-a)x(c-a) Or (b-a)x(c-b).
But be aware: The function seems to work somehow differently. I have trouble having them drawn in rotated orientation. Try it yourself and if you somehow succeed, please edit this and post your solution.
I recommend using a predefined function to call this.
[VB.NET]
Public Sub DrawPoly(a As Vector3, b As Vector3, c As Vector3, col As Color)
    [Function].Call(Hash.DRAW_POLY, a.X, a.Y, a.Z, b.X, b.Y, b.Z, c.X, c.Y, c.Z, col.R, col.G, col.B, col.A)
End Sub

[C#]
public void DrawPoly(Vector3 a, Vector3 b, Vector3 c, Color col)
{
    Function.Call(Hash.DRAW_POLY, a.X, a.Y, a.Z, b.X, b.Y, b.Z, c.X, c.Y, c.Z, col.R, col.G, col.B, col.A);
}
BTW: Intersecting triangles are not supported: They overlap in the order they were called.
