Returns the interior ID representing the requested interior at that location (if found?). The supplied interior string is not the same as the one used to load the interior.

Use: INTERIOR::UNPIN_INTERIOR(INTERIOR::GET_INTERIOR_AT_COORDS_WITH_TYPE(x, y, z, interior))

Interior types include: "V_Michael", "V_Franklins", "V_Franklinshouse", etc.. you can find them in the scripts.

Not a very useful native as you could just use GET_INTERIOR_AT_COORDS instead and get the same result, without even having to specify the interior type.
