p1 is anywhere from 4 to 7 in the scripts. Might be a weapon wheel group?

^It's kinda like that. 
7 returns true if you are equipped with any weapon except your fists.
6 returns true if you are equipped with any weapon except melee weapons.
5 returns true if you are equipped with any weapon except the Explosives weapon group.
4 returns true if you are equipped with any weapon except Explosives weapon group AND melee weapons.
3 returns true if you are equipped with either Explosives or Melee weapons (the exact opposite of 4).
2 returns true only if you are equipped with any weapon from the Explosives weapon group.
1 returns true only if you are equipped with any Melee weapon.
0 never returns true.

Note: When I say "Explosives weapon group", it does not include the Jerry can and Fire Extinguisher.
