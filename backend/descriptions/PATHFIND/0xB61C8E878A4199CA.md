When onGround == true outPosition is a position located on the nearest pavement.

When a safe coord could not be found the result of a function is false and outPosition == Vector3.Zero.

In the scripts these flags are used: 0, 14, 12, 16, 20, 21, 28. 0 is most commonly used, then 16. 

16 works for me, 0 crashed the script.
