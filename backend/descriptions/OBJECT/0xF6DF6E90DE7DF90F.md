Adjust the physics parameters of a prop, or otherwise known as "object". This is useful for simulated gravity.

Other parameters seem to be unknown.

p2: seems to be weight and gravity related. Higher value makes the obj fall faster. Very sensitive?
p3: seems similar to p2
p4: makes obj fall slower the higher the value
p5: similar to p4
