Loads a User-Generated Content (UGC) file. These files can be found in "[GTA5]\data\ugc" and "[GTA5]\common\patch\ugc". They seem to follow a naming convention, most likely of "[name]_[part].ugc". See example below for usage.

Returns whether or not the file was successfully loaded.

Example:
DATAFILE::_LOAD_UGC_FILE("RockstarPlaylists") // loads "rockstarplaylists_00.ugc"
