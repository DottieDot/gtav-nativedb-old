The inner function has a switch on the second parameter. It's the stuck timer index.

Here's some pseudo code I wrote for the inner function:
void __fastcall NATIVE_RESET_VEHICLE_STUCK_TIMER_INNER(CUnknown* unknownClassInVehicle, int timerIndex)
{
 switch (timerIndex)
   {
 case 0:
       unknownClassInVehicle->FirstStuckTimer = (WORD)0u;
 case 1:
       unknownClassInVehicle->SecondStuckTimer = (WORD)0u;
    case 2:
       unknownClassInVehicle->ThirdStuckTimer = (WORD)0u;
 case 3:
       unknownClassInVehicle->FourthStuckTimer = (WORD)0u;
    case 4:
       unknownClassInVehicle->FirstStuckTimer = (WORD)0u;
     unknownClassInVehicle->SecondStuckTimer = (WORD)0u;
        unknownClassInVehicle->ThirdStuckTimer = (WORD)0u;
     unknownClassInVehicle->FourthStuckTimer = (WORD)0u;
        break;
    };
}
