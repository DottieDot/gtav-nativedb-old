doorIndex:
0 = Front Right Door
1 = Front Left Door
2 = Back Right Door
3 = Back Left Door
4 = Hood
5 = Trunk

Changed last paramater from CreateDoorObject To NoDoorOnTheFloor because when on false, the door object is created,and not created when on true...the former parameter name was counter intuitive...(by Calderon)

Calderon is a moron.
