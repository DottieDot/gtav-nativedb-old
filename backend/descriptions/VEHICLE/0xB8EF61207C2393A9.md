starts at 100
Seams to have health zones
Front of vehicle when damaged goes from 100-50 and stops at 50.
Rear can be damaged from 100-0
Only tested with two cars.

any idea how this differs from the first one?

May return the vehicle health on a scale of 0.0 - 100.0 (needs to be confirmed)

example:

v_F = ENTITY::GET_ENTITY_MODEL(v_3);
if (((v_F == ${tanker}) || (v_F == ${armytanker})) || (v_F == ${tanker2})) {
    if (VEHICLE::_GET_VEHICLE_BODY_HEALTH_2(v_3) <= 1.0) {
        NETWORK::NETWORK_EXPLODE_VEHICLE(v_3, 1, 1, -1);
    }
}
