When I called this with what the script was doing, which was -190f for yaw pitch and roll, all my car did was jitter a little. I also tried 0 and 190f. I altered the p1 variable between TRUE and FALSE and didn't see a difference.

This might have something to do with the physbox of the vehicle, but I'm not sure.
