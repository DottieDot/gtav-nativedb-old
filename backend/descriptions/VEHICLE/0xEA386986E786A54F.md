Deletes a vehicle.
The vehicle must be a mission entity to delete, so call this before deleting: SET_ENTITY_AS_MISSION_ENTITY(vehicle, true, true);

eg how to use:
SET_ENTITY_AS_MISSION_ENTITY(vehicle, true, true);
DELETE_VEHICLE(&vehicle);

Deletes the specified vehicle, then sets the handle pointed to by the pointer to NULL.
